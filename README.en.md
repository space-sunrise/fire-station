**Fire Station is the first project in Space Station 14 to bring the SCP Foundation theme into the station's framework.** The project was first launched back in 2023. And the current 2.0 relaunch has completely revolutionized things, expanding SCP mechanics tenfold. <br>
Many new SCPs (objects), research mechanics, new dimensions, roles, and maps. Fire Station is a unique project with no analogues.
