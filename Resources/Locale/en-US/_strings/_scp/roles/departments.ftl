department-MobileTaskForce-description = A rapid response team to eliminate emergencies in the complex or conduct special operations.
department-InternalSecurity = Internal Security Department
department-InternalSecurity-description = The punishing sword of the Foundation, identifying threats among personnel, suppressing protocol violations, and ensuring that containment does not collapse due to human weakness or betrayal.
department-EthicsCommittee = Ethics Committee
department-EthicsCommittee-description = The Foundation's conscience, ensuring that the price of Containment does not exceed humanity, and that protocols do not turn us into the monsters we are called to control.
department-InternalTribunalService = Internal Tribunal Service
department-InternalTribunalService-description = The Foundation's court of last resort, where justice is meted out to traitors, protocol violators, and those who have jeopardized Containment itself. Their sentence is not subject to appeal.
department-HeavyContainmentSecurityService = Heavy Containment Security Service
department-HeavyContainmentSecurityService-description = The Foundation's body armor, standing between humanity and the most dangerous objects. Their rules are simple: if in doubt, shoot; if you're wrong, you die. Here, protocols replace commandments.
department-ExternalAdministrativeZoneSecurityService = External Administrative Zone Security Service
department-ExternalAdministrativeZoneSecurityService-description = Overseers of the visible part of the iceberg. They ensure that Class D personnel don't escape with a broom, and that scientists don't carry anomalies away in their pockets. Their weapon is not only automatic rifles, but also professionalism.
department-ScientificService = Scientific Service
department-ScientificService-description = The Foundation's inquisitive minds, turning anomalies into equations and chaos into guidelines. Their laboratories are right on the border between genius and madness, and each report can cost someone their sanity... or their life.
department-MedicalService = Medical Service
department-MedicalService-description = The Foundation's healers, patching up flesh and mind after encounters with the unimaginable. Their scalpels open up not only bodies, but the very nature of anomalies, and their medicine cabinets contain cocktails of antidepressants and amnestics.
department-EngineeringTechnicalService = Engineering and Technical Service

department-LogisticsService = Logistics Service
department-LogisticsService-description = The Foundation's invisible arteries, through which everything flows: from ammunition for security to coffee for O5. They will deliver anything, anywhere, and anytime - as long as the invoices say "standard office equipment."

department-FoodAndSanitationServiceDepartment-description = The Foundation's stomach and hygiene, feeding personnel and cleaning up the consequences of their mistakes.

department-LowAccessPersonnel = Class D Personnel
department-LowAccessPersonnel-description = The Foundation's expendable material, guinea pigs in a system where ethics give way to necessity. Their job is to test anomalies, their reward is an extra day of life, their pension is a neat urn with a number instead of a name.
department-SCP = SCP Objects
department-SCP-description = The living (and not so living) embodiment of the Foundation's nightmares. They are the reason scientists go gray, security drinks antidepressants, and all these protocols exist. They cannot be destroyed, cannot be understood - only contained, until they realize that we are not the ones writing the rules.
