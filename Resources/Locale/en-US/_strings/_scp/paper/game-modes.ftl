paper-neutralized-mode-info =
    ​[bold]THREAT LEVEL ASSESSMENT: NOMINAL[/bold]
    
    According to an automated risk assessment, the current level of anomalous object activity in the area is considered insignificant. All previously contained anomalies have been neutralized, relocated, or pose no security threat.
    ​[bullet] Staff operational mode — normal.
    ​[bullet] Staff are instructed to maintain a standard level of vigilance.
    ​[bullet] Scheduled technical, personnel, and scientific operations are permitted without restrictions.
    
    ​[italic]Special Note:[/italic] Due to the absence of current threats, the regional administration may initiate large-scale tests, protocol checks, and unscheduled drills.
paper-safe-mode-info =
    ​[bold]THREAT LEVEL ASSESSMENT: CONTROLLED[/bold]
    
    The area contains a number of anomalous objects classified as safe. One or more controlled high-risk subjects may be under observation.
    ​[bullet] Facility personnel are free to move around the area, with the exception of SCP object containment chambers.
    ​[bullet] Presence detected: safe objects and controlled instances of SCP-035 and/or one Euclid-class object.
    ​[bullet] Threats to personnel are considered unlikely if standard procedures are followed.
    
    ​[italic]Reminder:[/italic] Deviation from approved object handling procedures may lead to localized incidents.
paper-euclid-mode-info =
    ​[bold]THREAT LEVEL ASSESSMENT: ELEVATED[/bold]
    
    The area contains active anomalous subjects, including both predictable and unstable instances.
    ​[bullet] Security is advised to strictly control any interactions with anomalous objects.
    ​[bullet] Presence detected: Safe-class objects, one Euclid-class object, and possibly one Keter-class instance.
    ​[bullet] Situation control requires increased attention.
    
    ​[italic]Special Note:[/italic] Personnel are instructed to act within the framework of approved procedures, avoid unauthorized contact with anomalies, and immediately report any violations of containment conditions.
paper-keter-mode-info =
    ​[bold]THREAT LEVEL ASSESSMENT: CRITICAL[/bold]
    
    The area has transitioned to extended containment mode. One or more anomalous subjects pose a serious and immediate threat to existing security protocols.
    ​[bullet] Security is required to establish a duty mode near the containment chambers of active SCP objects.
    ​[bullet] Presence confirmed: at least one Keter-class object, as well as possible instances of Euclid and Safe classes.
    ​[bullet] The potential risk of losing control over objects is high.
    
    ​[italic]Attention:[/italic] Upon receiving a signal of a breach of containment conditions, immediately proceed to the nearest evacuation zone and await further instructions from regional command.
paper-thaumiel-mode-info =
    ​[bold]THREAT LEVEL ASSESSMENT: UNDETERMINED[/bold]
    
    The area contains several anomalies simultaneously, classified as objects of increased control. Their simultaneous containment is associated with unpredictable consequences.
    ​[bullet] Security is required to establish full control over interaction with SCP objects. The number of simultaneous interactions should not exceed more than once every 20 minutes.
    ​[bullet] Presence confirmed: multiple objects of Keter, Euclid, and Safe classes.
    ​[bullet] The situation is unstable, control is carried out under the "Top Secret" classification.
    
    ​[italic]Special Note:[/italic] Most operations are carried out under limited access conditions. Personnel who do not have the required level of access are strictly prohibited from interfering.
