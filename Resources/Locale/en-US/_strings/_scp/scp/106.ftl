    EMERGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT TO FACILITY PERSONNEL!

    Multiple breaches of stable reality have been detected. The number of dragged subjects exceeds the acceptable threshold.
    Probability of spatial collapse is 95%. Zone isolation does not guarantee safety. Normality will destabilize in {$time}

    INCIDENT CLASSIFICATION: DIMENSIONAL SHIFT

    Do not respond to their voices.

    {$time} until phase collapse
    SCP-106 is violating the boundaries of the known. Reality is losing its grip

    Evacuate the survivors. Close your eyes
    Do not breathe

scp106-dimension-shift-averted-announcement =
    Anomalous SCP-106 activity has been localized.
    Spatial parameters have been stabilized. Reality has been restored. The critical number of missing subjects has been normalized.

    Listen to the silence, while it still belongs to you.

    All rifts are sealed. The continuum is secured with reality anchors. The merging of worlds has been prevented.
    The complex remains within the space known to us.

    Personnel, you have done the impossible.
    But remember: cracks can reappear. Be prepared.

    ‼ PROTOCOL DIMENSIONAL SHIFT INITIATED ‼
    CONTAINMENT BREACH

    Rifts are consuming the structure of the complex. Local geometry is destroyed.
    Spatial isolation is impossible.

    CONTACT WITH PRIMARY REALITY LOST.
    RESIDUAL PERCEPTIONS DO NOT CONFORM TO ACCEPTABLE COGNITIVE PATTERNS.

    THREE-LEVEL DETONATION ACTIVATED.
    SAFETY WILL BE ACHIEVED AT AN ABSOLUTE PRICE
