ent-EyeDroplets = statis drops
    .desc = A transparent vial containing a colorless liquid. After application, it allows the user to not blink for a couple of minutes, which ensures the ability to safely observe SCP-173. Prolonged use may cause eye irritation.
ent-BaseScp096Mask = { "" }
    .desc = { "" }
ent-ClothingHeadBagScp096 = head bag
    .desc = A simple bag made of thick fabric, developed by the best minds of the foundation for gigantic sums of money. All ingenious things are simple. Just easily flies off the head when hit.
ent-ReinforcedMaskScp096 = omega mask
    .desc = A dense mask made of an unknown composite material. Specially designed to fit the head of SCP-096. Covers the wearer's face, preventing him from seeing it. Cheap to manufacture, which affects its ability to resist tearing for a long time. Advanced mounting systems reduce the chance of breakage during physical impact, but do not completely eliminate it.
ent-ClothingHeadHelmetAiPowered = helmet obscura
    .desc = An experimental multifunctional helmet with augmented reality glasses equipped with AI. Automatically analyzes the image of SCP-096 and erases his face from the user's field of view in real time, excluding the activation of the object. The finding algorithms are not perfect, it is possible that the built-in AI ​​may fail.
ent-Scp049ProtectionImplanter = aegis implanter
    .desc = A portable device containing a single-use implant made of biocompatible material. Once installed in the body, it blocks the effects of SCP-049 on the user's tissues, preventing surgical transformation. Development is at the prototype stage, side effects are possible.
ent-Scp049ProtectionImplant = aegis implant
    .desc = A single-use implant made of biocompatible material.
ent-ClothingOuterAntiTeleportation = locus vest
    .desc = Protective tactical vest with sewn-in anomalous modules. Creates a field around the user that blocks the teleportation effects of SCP-106.
ent-ClothingShoesSilent = mimicry boots
    .desc = Special shoes with adaptive soles that absorb sounds during movement. Significantly reduces noise levels, allowing the user to remain undetected by SCP-939.
ent-ClothingHeadAwareness = helmet integra
    .desc = Ergonomic helmet with built-in neural protection. Worn on the head and blocks the anomalous effects of SCP-035, preventing attempts to manipulate the wearer.
ent-WeaponGodlikeXRay = rail incinerator "Last Salvo" XR
    .desc = Experimental energy rifle using anomalous technologies. Generates a powerful X-RAY laser that incinerates the target and leaves radioactive ash. The radiation level is dangerous to others, the weapon requires special protection when used.
ent-WeaponARLSniper = laser sniper rifle "Enigma"
    .desc = High-precision laser sniper rifle created on the basis of anomalous technologies. A shot generates a concentrated beam of high power, capable of penetrating armor and vulnerable materials. Used only under strict control.
