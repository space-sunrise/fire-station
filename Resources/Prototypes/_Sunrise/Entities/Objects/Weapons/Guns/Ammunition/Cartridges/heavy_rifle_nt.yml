  description: A NanoTrasen full-power 7.62x51mm cartridge designed for frontier and planetary combat. While powerful and long-ranged, it's ill-suited for close-quarters shipboard use, making it more common in legacy armories and colonial outposts.

While powerful and long-ranged, it's ill-suited for close-quarters shipboard use, making it more common in legacy armories and colonial outposts.
